## What is Vangr?

Vangr is an early-stage project with four core goals:

* Deliver powerful task-focused software collections, prioritizing the best tools for the job.
* Reduce busywork with pre-tuned configs and templates.
* Build a community rooted in learning and support.
* Of course, make it all look good too.

## Why Vangr?

While Linux has grown easier to use over the years, it still has rough edges. For power users and developers? These edges are easily smoothed. For everyday fólk? Even something simple like gaming has its pain points. I want to change that. Vangr won't be able to smooth every edge, but it can attempt to work down the most obvious ones.
